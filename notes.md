# üìö Problem Description: Limitations of K-Means for Book Shelf Clustering

I'm organizing my book collection onto a fixed number of shelves by clustering books based on metadata like genre, author, series, and language. I initially chose **K-Means clustering** because it provides a straightforward mapping between the number of clusters and the number of shelves.

However, after testing and reviewing the results, I encountered several limitations with K-Means in this context:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues with K-Means

### 1. Assumes Spherical, Equally-Sized Clusters
- K-Means tends to form clusters of similar size and shape.
- This doesn't match the natural structure of my library, where some clusters (e.g., large series or popular genres) are much larger than others.

### 2. Insensitive to Categorical/One-Hot Features
- Most of my book metadata is **categorical** (e.g., genre tags, language, author, series).
- After one-hot encoding, K-Means doesn‚Äôt handle these features well. All distances are treated equally, even if some features (like series or language) should weigh more heavily in grouping decisions.

### 3. Sensitive to Initialization
- K-Means results vary across runs due to random initialization.
- Even when fixing the seed, it often splits books from the same series or author into different clusters.

### 4. Poor Interpretability
- Final cluster groupings don‚Äôt always make intuitive sense.
- Books that seem unrelated end up on the same "shelf," while logical groups are split.

## üîÅ Planned Changes

To address these limitations, I plan to experiment with the following improvements:

### ‚úÖ Switch to Hierarchical Clustering
- Hierarchical clustering doesn‚Äôt require assumptions about cluster size or shape.
- It produces a dendrogram showing nested groupings, which can be **cut at the number of shelves** I have to form clusters.
- This approach better respects relationships in categorical data (e.g., series, authors).

### ‚úÖ Apply Feature Weights
- Not all features are equally important.
- I plan to **weight features like author, series, and language more heavily** than general genre tags so that books from the same series or language are more likely to be grouped together.

### ‚úÖ Improve Distance Metric
- Euclidean distance isn‚Äôt ideal for high-dimensional binary vectors.
- I‚Äôll explore **Hamming distance** or **cosine similarity**, which are more appropriate for sparse binary data.

### ‚úÖ Optional: Use Agglomerative Clustering with Precomputed Distance
- If using a custom similarity matrix (e.g., from cosine or Hamming distances), I can feed this directly into agglomerative clustering.

These changes should allow shelf groupings that are more natural, interpretable, and useful ‚Äî especially for keeping series and multilingual books together while making good use of shelf space.
