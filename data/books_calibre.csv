Over 3 million copies sold! Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to: - make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); - overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; - design your environment to make success easier; - get back on track when you fall off course; ...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.

"Cheating Lessons: Learning From Academic Dishonesty","James M. Lang","","Behaviorism, Social Psychology, Education, Schools, Levels, Higher, Teaching, Testing & Measurement, Psychology","Harvard University Press","2013-09-02T00:00:00-04:00","eng","Nearly three-quarters of college students cheat during their undergraduate careers, a startling number attributed variously to the laziness of today’s students, their lack of a moral compass, or the demands of a hypercompetitive society. For James Lang, cultural or sociological explanations like these are red herrings. His provocative new research indicates that students often cheat because their learning environments give them ample incentives to try—and that strategies which make cheating less worthwhile also improve student learning. Cheating Lessons is a practical guide to tackling academic dishonesty at its roots. 
Drawing on an array of findings from cognitive theory, Lang analyzes the specific, often hidden features of course design and daily classroom practice that create opportunities for cheating. Courses that set the stakes of performance very high, that rely on single assessment mechanisms like multiple-choice tests, that have arbitrary grading criteria: these are the kinds of conditions that breed cheating. Lang seeks to empower teachers to create more effective learning environments that foster intrinsic motivation, promote mastery, and instill the sense of self-efficacy that students need for deep learning. 
Although cheating is a persistent problem, the prognosis is not dire. The good news is that strategies which reduce cheating also improve student performance overall. Instructors who learn to curb academic dishonesty will have done more than solve a course management problem—they will have become better educators all around.

"Beyond Good and Evil","Friedrich Nietzsche & Helen Zimmern","","Philosophy, Good & Evil, Psychology, Ethics, Behaviorism","Digireads.com Publishing","2015-11-15T00:00:00-04:00","eng","German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche was one the most controversial figures of the 19th century. His evocative writings on religion, morality, culture, philosophy, and science were often polemic attacks against the established views of his time. First published in 1886, ""Beyond Good and Evil"" is a work that draws upon and expands the ideas that Nietzsche first addressed in his previous work, ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra. 
"" Nietzsche contrasts the concepts of good and evil as they were viewed in ancient times with the modern interpretations of them. As he asserts, the initial form of morality arises from the warrior nature of the ruling castes of ancient civilizations, who viewed themselves as good because of their wealth and power in contrast to the weakness of those that they enslaved. He further describes how the recasting of these ancient values through religion has given rise to a new ""slave"" morality, which defines goodness by a set of virtues which are contradictory to those of the ruling classes. Ultimately ""Beyond Good and Evil"" is a harsh criticism of philosophical systems that described a good person as the opposite of an evil one rather than just a relative expression of the impulses inherent in all men. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper, is translated by Helen Zimmern, and includes introductions by Willard Huntington Wright and Thomas Common.

Who is John Galt? When he says that he will stop the motor of the world, is he a destroyer or a liberator? Why does he have to fight his battles not against his enemies but against those who need him most? Why does he fight his hardest battle against the woman he loves?You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the amazing men and women in this book. You will discover why a productive genius becomes a worthless playboy...why a great steel industrialist is working for his own destruction...why a composer gives up his career on the night of his triumph...why a beautiful woman who runs a transcontinental railroad falls in love with the man she has sworn to kill. 
Atlas Shrugged, a modern classic and Rand’s most extensive statement of Objectivism—her groundbreaking philosophy—offers the reader the spectacle of human greatness, depicted with all the poetry and power of one of the twentieth century’s leading artists.

They existed only to serve the state. They were conceived in controlled Palaces of Mating. They died in the Home of the Useless. From cradle to grave, the crowd was one—the great WE.In all that was left of humanity there was only one man who dared to think, seek, and love. He lived in the dark ages of the future. In a loveless world, he dared to love the woman of his choice. In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization, he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crimes for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: He had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone. He had rediscovered the lost and holy word—I.“I worship individuals for their highest possibilities as individuals, and I loathe humanity, for its failure to live up to these possibilities.”—Ayn Rand

Professor Pierre Aronnax was rescued from drowning by Captain Nemo, who insists that in order to protect the secret of his submarine, Aronnax must stay on board the Nautilus for the rest of his life. They explore the oceans, with the inspired author guiding them through a terrific array of undersea wonders, some based on reality and others wholly imagined. Giving his lush imagination free rein Verne describes his characters encountering sunken ships, Antarctic ice, and the drowned city of Atlantis, spicing the action with an unforgettable battle with giant squid. Though it all Aronnax notes Captain Nemo’s hatred for the nations of the surface world, which builds until it borders on madness and Aronnax and his companions realize that they must find a way to escape. First appearing in 1870, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was an immediate success and has remained one of the author’s most esteemed works ever since. Celebrated for its prescient treatment of the submarine, the novel has also been steadily re-examined by critics who have found political, social and ecological subtexts in the book. Readers will find, as they have for 150 years, a richly engaging adventure story full of thrills, inventiveness and wonder. With an eye-catching new cover, and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is both modern and readable.

P. Lovecraft horror story that tells the tale of Wilbur Whateley, son of a deformed albino mother and an unknown father, and the strange events surrounding his birth and precocious development. Wilbur Whateley matures at an abnormal rate, reaching manhood within a decade--all the while indoctrinated him into dark rituals and witchcraft by his grandfather. 
In the isolated, desolate, decrepit village of Dunwich, Massachusetts, Wilbur Whateley is the hideous son of Lavinia Whateley, a deformed and unstable albino mother, and an unknown father (alluded to in passing by mad Old Whateley, as ""Yog-Sothoth""). Strange events surround his birth and precocious development. Wilbur matures at an abnormal rate, reaching manhood within a decade. Locals shun him and his family, and animals fear and despise him due to his odor. All the while, his sorcerer grandfather indoctrinates him into certain dark rituals and the study of witchcraft. Various locals grow suspicious after Old Whateley buys more and more cattle, yet the number of his herd never increases, and the cattle in his field become mysteriously afflicted with severe open wounds. 
Wilbur and his grandfather have sequestered an unseen presence at their farmhouse; this being is connected somehow to Yog-Sothoth. Year by year, this unseen entity grows to monstrous proportions, requiring the two men to make frequent modifications to their residence. People begin to notice a trend of cattle mysteriously disappearing. Wilbur Whateley's grandfather dies, and his mother disappears soon afterwards. The colossal entity eventually occupies the whole interior of the farmhouse. Wilbur Whateley ventures to Miskatonic University in Arkham to procure their copy of the Necronomicon - Miskatonic's library is one of only a handful in the world to stock an original. The Necronomicon has spells that Wilbur Whateley can use to summon the Old Ones, but his family's copy is damaged and lacks the page he needs to open the ""door. 
"" When the librarian, Dr. Henry Armitage, refuses to release the university's copy to him (and, by sending warnings to other libraries, thwarts Wilbur's efforts to consult their copies), Wilbur Whateley breaks into the library at night to steal it. A guard dog, maddened by Wilbur's alien body odor, attacks and kills him with unusual ferocity. When Dr. Armitage and two other professors, Warren Rice and Francis Morgan, arrive on the scene, they see Wilbur's semi-human corpse before it melts completely, leaving no evidence. 
Wilbur WhateleyBorn February 2, 1913 at 5 a.m. to Lavinia Whateley and Yog-Sothoth. Described as a ""dark, goatish-looking infant""-neighbors refer to him as ""Lavinny's black brat""-he shows extreme precocity: ""Within three months of his birth, he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age.... At seven months, Wilbur Whateley began to walk unassisted,"" and he ""commenced to talk...at the age of only eleven months.

"The Awakening: A Novel","Kate Chopin","","Fiction, Classics, Women, Literary","Random House Publishing Group","2019-06-18T00:00:00-04:00","eng","A new edition of Kate Chopin’s controversial masterpiece, an essential novel in the canon of early feminism—with an introduction by Carmen Maria Machado, award-winning author of Her Body and Other Parties. “Whatever came, she had resolved never again to belong to another than herself.” With its forthright treatment of sex and depression, The Awakening, first published in 1899, was so shocking to turn-of-the-century readers that it was neglected for decades. Rediscovered in the 1960s, this brief, beautiful novel is considered a landmark of early feminism. It is the story of Edna Pontellier, a twenty-eight-year-old wife and mother of two who—with devastating consequences—rejects her conventional married life for a transgressive path of self-discovery. Edna is vacationing with her husband and children on the Louisiana Gulf Coast when she meets and falls in love with the passionate, impulsive Robert Lebrun. Afterward, Edna can no longer find meaning and satisfaction in her comfortable domestic life and moves out, alone. Her tragic quest for personal, creative, and erotic freedom is at the heart of this now-classic novel which captures women’s desires with extraordinary frankness, sympathy, and intensity. The Modern Library Torchbearers series features women who wrote on their own terms, with boldness, creativity, and a spirit of resistance.

How the majesty of Rapture, the shining city below the sea, became an instant dystopia It's the end of World War II. FDR's New Deal has redefined American politics. Taxes are at an all-time high. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has brought a fear of total annihilation. The rise of secret government agencies and sanctions on business has many watching their backs.

Among them is a great dreamer, an immigrant who pulled himself from the depths of poverty to become one of the wealthiest and admired men in the world. That man is Andrew Ryan, and he believed that great men and women deserve better. And so he set out to create the impossible, a utopia free from government, censorship, and moral restrictions on science—where what you give is what you get. He created Rapture—the shining city below the sea. But as we all know, this utopia suffered a great tragedy. This is the story of how it all came to be...and how it all ended.

"Ender's Game","Orson Scott Card","","Fiction, Science Fiction, Action & Adventure, Space Opera","Macmillan","1992-08-15T00:00:00-04:00","eng","From New York Times bestselling author Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game—adapted to film in 2013 starring Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford—is the classic Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction novel of a young boy's recruitment into the midst of an interstellar war. 
In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training. 
Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. 
Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives. 
Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

To you, my most faithful, I dedicate this, the final production of 'The Mystery of the Pale King.'"" As an orphan growing up in a distant border province, Faron took pride in the epic tales of the Hero of Hathur, a great and powerful warrior who ruled in the name of the sun-worshipping Church of the Sol Creator. That pride is shattered by accusations from the Hero's family that he squandered their entire inheritance on the production of a profane play with him at the center: ""The Mystery of the Pale King. 
"" The Church proclaims him under interdict and dispatches Bishop Antonius, his devoted page Faron, and a cadre of soldiers downriver to repossess Hathur on its behalf. The cruelty they witness on their perilous mission forces them to confront the horrors at the heart of Hathur's past and question not just their devotion to the Church but their very beliefs in gods and heroes. Amid a storm of betrayal, murder, and sacrilege, Faron must survive fanatical cultists, their obscene rituals, and the evil hiding in the light in order to save Bishop Antonius from the Hero's final performance. Inspired by the historical legend of Gilles de Rais, The Mystery of the Pale King probes the roots of modern American dysfunction in a grim flintlock fantasy setting that reflects the best and worst of humanity.

In a small New England town, over half a century ago, a shadow falls over a small boy playing with his toy soldiers. Jamie Morton looks up to see a striking man, the new minister. Charles Jacobs, along with his beautiful wife, will transform the local church. The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs. Jacobs; the women and girls feel the same about Reverend Jacobs--including Jamie's mother and beloved sister, Claire. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond based on a secret obsession. When tragedy strikes the Jacobs family, this charismatic preacher curses God, mocks all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town. Jamie has demons of his own. Wed to his guitar from the age of thirteen, he plays in bands across the country, living the nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll while fleeing from his family's horrific loss. In his mid-thirties--addicted to heroin, stranded, desperate--Jamie meets Charles Jacobs again, with profound consequences for both men. Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil's devising, and Jamie discovers that ""revival"" has many meanings. This rich and disturbing novel spans five decades on its way to the most terrifying conclusion Stephen King has ever written. It's a masterpiece from King, in the great American tradition of Frank Norris, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Edgar Allan Poe.

The only problem is, he's in the fifth grade, his hair's too short, his pants are too denim, and the town's too small. The Huey Lewis and the News song blaring out of the radio isn't helping, either. That's when Chuck's brother arrives home with a cassette from hell -- Motley Crue's ""Shout at the Devil. 
"" And so the twisted journey begins... In this hilarious, young-man-growing-up-with-a-soundtrack tradition, ""Fargo Rock City"" chronicles Klosterman's formative years and the history of rock through the lens of '80s heavy metal. He knows what it's like to slow-dance to a Poison tune; to sleep inno- cently under satanic symbols; to confess your lust for Lita Ford; to understand that Bon Jovi sounds best in a pickup; to shoot baskets as a member of the KISS Army; to get intellectual about Guns N' Roses; and, yes, to have a nasty relationship with your first ATM card. With a voice like Ace Frehley's guitar, Chuck hacks and riffs his way through this savvy, deliriously funny memoir of growing up as a shameless metalhead in Wyndmere, North Dakota. Against all odds, he parties like a rock star. Your story may be exactly the same or completely different, but if you grew up anywhere close to the 1980s, then your life has been touched by hair metal. Chuck Klosterman is here to explain why this matters.

Paris Armstrong never saw it coming. With two grown children and a lovely home in Connecticut, Paris was happy with her marriage, her family, her life. So when her husband of twenty-four years said they needed to talk, Paris couldn’ t imagine what he was about to say. “I want a divorce,” Peter tells her. Just like that, the husband she adored had dumped her for a younger woman. And just like that, Peter and his thirty-one-year-old lover had made their plans for their future, leaving Paris to pick up the pieces of a shattered life. Within days, Peter was gone. And Paris was left to figure out how she intended to get through the next day, let alone the rest of her life. The task could not have been more painful. First came the tears. Then the excruciating attempts by well-meaning friends to “fix her up” with men who paled in comparison to Peter. Worse yet, she still loved him. Finally, Paris realized she was in a fight for her very survival. Drastic measures were called for. Even her shrink agreed. It was time to move—as far away as possible, just after Peter remarried. Paris had never felt, or been, more alone. Saying good-bye to the world she knew and loved, Paris heads west, to San Francisco, and discovers being single in a world full of men who were too young, too old, too married, or too good to be true. For Paris, the list seemed endless...the charming commitment-phobe...the drunken Neanderthal...the young Frenchman—so adorably sexy she almost forgot about his age, and did, for a while. With her dating track record veering between disappointing and disastrous, and her daughter now engaged to a man Paris’s age, Paris finally comes to the conclusion that romance is not in her future. That’s when her small circle of offbeat, loving friends becomes more important than ever before. And a decision Paris makes only for herself changes her life once more. The secret, she discovers finally, is in finding the gifts in life’s unexpected twists and turns, and turning despair into freedom and loss into joy. In a poignant, wickedly funny novel about getting dumped and getting over it, about tackling life with both courage and laughter, Danielle Steel explores what it means to start over, whether you wanted to or not, and finding something better than you had before.

Inside the gated woods, ancient laws keep relative order among greedy trolls, mischievous satyrs, plotting witches, spiteful imps, and jealous fairies.

The poem is a spiritual autobiography in journey form -- the poet travels from the dark circles of the Inferno, up the mountain of Purgatory, where Virgil, his guide, leaves him to encounter Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise. Dante conceived the poem a the new epic of Christendom, and he creates a world in which reason and faith have transformed moral and social chaos into order. Charles Sisson's blank verse translation is remarkable for its lucidity and vigor, and the introduction, diagrams, maps, and notes by David Higgins provide the reader with invaluable guidance. -- From publisher's description.

"Dracula","Bram Stoker","","Fiction, Horror, Dystopian, Literary, Occult & Supernatural, Gothic, Supernatural, Classics, Romance","Graphic Arts Books","2020-04-07T00:00:00-04:00","eng","In 1897, Bram Stoker published what has now become one of the most revered horror stories of its time. Dracula has inspired the gothic genre for generations, continuing to this day to frighten and delight its readers for anyone brave enough to face the world of blood thirsty vampires in search of their next mortal victim. In a gripping and sensational work of classic Gothic fiction we discover the infamous Count Dracula. When English lawyer Jonathan Harker travels to an obscure town called Transylvania, the goal of his visit was most certainly not to do business with a vampire. As he makes his way through the village square, Harker is overcome with an eerie sensation that the Count is not who he says he is. Strewn with various charms and trinkets thrown at him from the local village people, Harker comes to find that the weird looks, whispers, and pointed fingers directed at him are not done so in jest at him being a tourist. Rather, they are a clear warning that the Count is perhaps more dangerous than he imagined. Brimming with observations on the eventual paradigmatic shifts of society, Stoker’s intent with Dracula extends much further than the plot of quarreling vampires. With references to the sexual politics of women in the Victorian era to the astute observations following the modernization of society, Stoker’s ideas and writings were insightfully ahead of the times. Dracula has continued to play an influential role in the canon of literature, and for a blood-curdling and frighteningly good reason.

"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde","Robert Stevenson","","Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, Romance, Occult & Supernatural, Classics","Aegitas","2023-05-11T00:00:00-04:00","eng","⁠ The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a novella written by Robert Louis Stevenson and published in 1886. It is a gripping tale of the duality of human nature, exploring the themes of good and evil, morality, and identity. The story is set in Victorian London and follows the life of Dr. Henry Jekyll, a respected and wealthy physician, who becomes obsessed with the idea of separating the good and evil within himself. The story begins with Mr. Utterson, a lawyer, who is perplexed by the strange behavior of his friend Dr. Jekyll. He notices that Dr. Jekyll has become reclusive and has been seen in the company of an unsavory character named Mr. Hyde. Mr. Utterson becomes increasingly concerned when he learns that Dr. Jekyll has left his entire fortune to Mr. Hyde in his will. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Mr. Hyde is not just an unsavory character but is in fact the evil alter ego of Dr. Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll had created a potion that allowed him to transform into Mr. Hyde, giving him the freedom to indulge in his darkest desires without fear of judgment or consequence. However, as time goes on, the transformations become more frequent and unpredictable, leading to tragic consequences for those around him. The novella is a masterful exploration of the human psyche and the struggle between good and evil within each person. It highlights the dangers of repressing one's desires and urges, as well as the consequences of indulging in them without restraint. The character of Mr. Hyde represents the dark side of human nature, and Dr. Jekyll's struggle to control him represents the constant battle between good and evil within us all. The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a timeless classic that continues to captivate readers with its suspenseful plot, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the importance of understanding and accepting our own inner demons.

"Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen","","Fiction, Classics, Romance, Women, Family & Relationships","CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","2016-07-16T00:00:00-04:00","eng","Pride and prejudice : a novel, By Jane Austencomplete in ine volume Pride and Prejudice is a novel of manners by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman, Mr. Bennet, living in Longbourn. 
Page 2 of a letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First Impressions. (NLA)Set in England in the late 18th century, Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet''s five unmarried daughters after two gentlemen have moved into their neighbourhood: the rich and eligible Mr. Bingley, and his status-conscious friend, the even more rich and eligible Mr. Darcy. While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy is disdainful of local society and repeatedly clashes with the Bennets'' lively second daughter, Elizabeth. 
Pride and Prejudice retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of ""most loved books"". It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, selling over 20 million copies, and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Likewise, it has paved the way for archetypes that abound in many contemporary literature of our time. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen''s memorable characters or themes. 
The novel centres on Elizabeth Bennet, the second of the five daughters of a landed country gentleman. Elizabeth''s father, Mr. Bennet, is a bookish man and somewhat neglectful of his responsibilities. In contrast Elizabeth''s mother, Mrs. Bennet, a woman who lacks social graces, is primarily concerned with finding suitable husbands for her five daughters, who will inherit little or nothing from their father due to primogeniture laws. Jane Bennet, the eldest daughter, is distinguished by her kindness and beauty; Elizabeth Bennet shares her father''s keen wit and occasionally sarcastic outlook; Mary is studious, devout and musical albeit lacking in taste; Catherine, sometimes called Kitty, the fourth sister, follows where her younger sister leads while Lydia is flirtatious and lacks maturity. 
The narrative opens with news in the Bennet family that Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, charismatic and sociable young bachelor, is moving into Netherfield Park in the neighbourhood. Mr. Bingley is soon well received while his friend Mr. Darcy makes a less favourable impression by appearing proud and condescending at a ball that they attend (he detests dancing and is not one for light conversation). Mr. Bingley singles out Jane for particular attention, and it soon becomes apparent that they have formed an attachment to each other. While Jane does not alter her conduct for him, she confesses her great happiness only to Lizzie. By contrast, Darcy slights Elizabeth, who overhears and jokes about it despite feeling a budding resentment. 
Upon paying a visit to Mr. 
Bingley''s sister, Caroline, Jane is caught in a heavy downpour, catching cold, and is forced to stay at Netherfield for several days. Elizabeth arrives to nurse her sister and is thrown into frequent company with Mr. 
Darcy, who begins to act less coldly towards her. 
Mr. 
Collins,a clergyman and heir to Longbourn, the Bennet estate, pays a visit to the Bennets. 
Mr. 
Bennet and Elizabeth are much amused by his obsequious veneration of his employer,the noble Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as well as by his self-important and pedantic nature. 
It soon becomes apparent that Mr. Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth,who refuses him, much to her mother''s distress. Mr. Collins recovers and promptly becomes engaged to Elizabeth''s close friend Charlotte Lucas, a homely woman with few prospects.

Often underappreciated, it represents a true folk art, encompassing design motifs and themes that are expressions of the heart, the desires, loves, and ambitions of the artists and those who wear their artworks. After carefully studying work by renowned American tattoo artists (including Paul Rogers, Leonard ""Stoney"" St. 
Clair, George Burchett, August ""Cap"" Coleman, Percy Waters, Owen James and others) the author distilled it into five component colors: black, red, yellow, green, and brown, and developed a new interpretation of their classic styles. Besides classic designs by the author, the images here include collaborative work with other tattoo designers. Over 640 individual flash designs are reproduced in color as a celebration of the tradition and the hope that it will continue as folk art.

The book also features a dozen original illustrations by Schiffmacher in his inimitable style. Schiffmacher brings a fascinating perspective to tattoo history through his personal reflections and wild tales of adventure.

K. Rowling y publicado por primera vez, en inglés, el 16 de julio de 2005.La novela relata los acontecimientos posteriores a Harry Potter y la Orden del Fénix y que preceden a Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte. Desarrollada en el sexto año de Harry Potter en el Colegio Hogwarts, la obra explora el pasado del mago oscuro Lord Voldemort, así como los preparativos del protagonista junto con su mentor Albus Dumbledore para la batalla final detallada en el siguiente libro, el último de la serie. 
Para su país de origen, Reino Unido, la editorial Bloomsbury publicó el libro el mismo día en el que Scholastic Corporation hizo llegar su edición a Estados Unidos, con una tirada inicial que consistió en 10,8 millones de ejemplares en territorio angloparlante. En cambio, la editorial propietaria de los derechos de publicación en castellano, Editorial Salamandra, publicó su versión el 23 de febrero de 2006; el título de la edición en español difirió del sentido del original, dado que literalmente se traduce como Harry Potter y el príncipe mestizo. 
La obra logró el éxito tanto comercialmente como en críticas, rompió récords de ventas y ganó diversos premios literarios y una aceptación por parte de los círculos de la industria literaria. Muchas de las críticas hechas a la novela giraron en torno a la evolución del estilo de Rowling pues se alejaba del tono infantil con el que había construido sus novelas anteriores, por lo que se recalcó la ambientación sombría que guardaba la historia. No obstante, el hecho de que el final pareciese predecible a través de ciertos pasajes fue objeto de varias críticas. En sus primeras 24 horas de publicación se comercializaron nueve millones de copias, récord que superaría más tarde su secuela. 
Se realizó una adaptación en formato de audiolibro, el cual comenzó a distribuirse el mismo día que la novela homónima. El largometraje basado en la novela, que contó con la dirección de David Yates, se estrenó en cines cuatro años después, el 15 de julio de 2009. Igualmente se han creado videojuegos sobre el libro, uno lanzado en 2009 con la finalidad de que coincidiese con el debut de la película, y otro como parte de la bilogía de juegos Lego Harry Potter.
